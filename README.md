# Houdini OpenCL

OpenCL in Houdini doesn't have much documentation, so hopefully this helps someone!

## Where to find help

When debugging OpenCL, often you're on your own. The best place to look is inside the Houdini files.

The `houdini/ocl` folder in your Houdini install folder contains lots of OpenCL examples:

```c
// Type this in any text field to evaluate the path
// C:/Program Files/Side Effects Software/Houdini <VERSION>/houdini/ocl
$HH/ocl
```

This is also where you find helper libraries such as `matrix.h`. These libraries can be included using `#include <matrix.h>`

```c
// Type this in any text field to evaluate the path
// C:/Program Files/Side Effects Software/Houdini <VERSION>/houdini/ocl/include/matrix.h
$HH/ocl/include/matrix.h

// To use this library in OpenCL
#include <matrix.h>
```

## What is OpenCL?

Houdini has many built-in programming languages including Python, VEX/VOPS and OpenCL.

| Language | Runs on | Pain | Speed | Libraries/helper functions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | -- |
| Python | CPU + GPU | Easy | Slow |Many |
| VEX/VOPS | CPU only | Medium | Fast | Some |
| OpenCL | CPU + GPU + Anything supporting OpenCL | Hard | Fast | Very few |

OpenCL is the lowest level language you can access in Houdini, and can be the fastest if used correctly.

It's is similar to VEX since they're both C-style languages, but it's much simpler and barely has any libraries.

OpenCL is intended for low-level data processing. It doesn't have any high-level functions like `intersect()` or `xyzdist()`, only reading, writing and basic math operations.

While VEX only runs on the CPU, OpenCL can run on the GPU, CPU and any other devices that support it. It's a general purpose computing language so it's not specific to Houdini.

It's much faster than VEX at certain tasks, like feedback loops (Attribute Blur) and anything involving neighbours (Vellum). It's commonly found in solvers and used for image processing in COPS.

Some people get tempted to use OpenCL just because it's fast. While OpenCL is fast, it's painful to use and easy to cause memory leaks if you don't know programming well. For this reason you should only use OpenCL when absolutely necessary. Otherwise it's better to use VEX.

Like VEX, OpenCL supports multithreading so the performance of VEX and OpenCL are similar. OpenCL is only faster if you write code that takes advantage of what it does well.

To take advantage of OpenCL fully, you must know how OpenCL runs operations.

## How OpenCL runs

OpenCL runs in parallel. Unlike in VEX, operations cannot run in order.

This makes OpenCL a bad choice for any algorithm that requires order. Such algorithms should be run in VEX instead.

A regular for loop would run in series:

```c
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
```

OpenCL runs in parallel, so it runs in chunks instead. If each chunk was 4 numbers long, it might run in this order:

```c
// |    Chunk 0    |   Chunk 1   |     Chunk 2     |   Chunk 3  |
     8, 9, 10, 11,   0, 1, 2, 3,   12, 13, 14, 15,   4, 5, 6, 7
```

- Chunks are called **local workgroups**. `8, 9, 10, 11` is a **local workgroup** of size 4.
- Each **local workgroup** is part of a **global workgroup**. All of these numbers could be in global workgroup `0`.
- Each number is called a **workitem**. `0` is a workitem.

Like you'd expect, you can access the [offset and sizes](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/get_work_dim.html) for these things.

```c
// Offsets
int global_id = get_global_id(0); // @elemnum when using @ bindings
int local_id = get_local_id(0);
int group_id = get_group_id(0);

// Sizes
int global_size = get_global_size(0); // @attr.len when using @ bindings
int local_size = get_local_size(0);
int num_groups = get_num_groups(0);
```

[Check the OpenCL documentation](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/get_work_dim.html) for more functions you can use.

Often there's only one global workgroup, but there can be many.

For example if you use worksets, it runs the same kernel multiple times. Conceptually this is like having multiple global workgroups.

## @ bindings

@ bindings are an optional feature added by SideFX to save you from writing tedious boilerplate OpenCL code.

I don't recommend using @ bindings until you learn how to write regular OpenCL, because they add another layer of confusion.

@ bindings automatically do these things for you:

- Automatically add bindings to attributes/data (not shown in the "Bindings" tab)
- Automatically add kernel arguments to pass in the attribute/data
- Automatically add `#define` directives to let you access the attribute/data with `@` syntax

@ bindings generate the exact same OpenCL code under the hood, but let you use a VEX-like syntax instead.

You can view the regular OpenCL code by going to the "Generated Code" tab and clicking "Generate Kernel". This is the OpenCL it actually runs.

In in the generated kernel, you'll see a lot of `#define` lines. `#define` is a C preprocessor directive that replaces text with other text. For example:

```c
// Replace hello with goodbye
#define hello goodbye

// Prints "goodbye"
printf("hello");
```

This is exactly what @ bindings are doing. They replace `@P` with the equivalent OpenCL read/write instruction for that data type.

## Fixing "1 warning generated" errors

Sometimes OpenCL spams the message "1 warning generated", but doesn't spam the actual warning.

This can be fixed by setting the environment variable `HOUDINI_OCL_REPORT_BUILD_LOGS` to `1` before starting Houdini.
