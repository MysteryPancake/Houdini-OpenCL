# Houdini OpenCL

OpenCL in Houdini doesn't have much documentation, so hopefully this helps someone!

## Where to find OpenCL resources

Houdini doesn't have many OpenCL resources. I strongly recommend checking the Houdini files for examples.

The `houdini/ocl` folder in your Houdini directory contains tons of OpenCL files.

```c
// Type this in any text field to evaluate the path
// On Windows: C:/Program Files/Side Effects Software/Houdini <VERSION>/houdini/ocl
$HH/ocl
```

This is also where you find helper libraries, such as the matrix library `matrix.h`.

`#include` means to insert the code from a file into your file. You can do this for any OpenCL file in `houdini/ocl`.

```c
// Type this in any text field to evaluate the path
// On Windows: C:/Program Files/Side Effects Software/Houdini <VERSION>/houdini/ocl/include/matrix.h
$HH/ocl/include/matrix.h

// To include a library located in houdini/ocl/include:
#include <matrix.h>

// To include files in other directories:
#include "../sim/vbd_energy.cl"
```

Another place to look is Copernicus. Some Copernicus nodes contain OpenCL nodes with embedded code inside them.

Though it's uncommon, some solvers like the Ripple Solver contain OpenCL nodes with embedded code inside them.

I'm also working on [a solver written in OpenCL](https://github.com/MysteryPancake/Houdini-VBD). The code is in the `ocl` folder on that page.

## What is OpenCL?

Houdini has many built-in programming languages including Python, VEX/VOPS and OpenCL.

| Language | Runs on | Pain | Speed | Libraries/helper functions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | -- |
| Python | CPU + GPU | Easy | Slow |Many |
| VEX/VOPS | CPU only | Medium | Fast | Some |
| OpenCL | CPU + GPU + Anything supporting OpenCL | Hard | Fast | Very few |

OpenCL is the lowest level language you can access in Houdini, and can be the fastest when used correctly.

It's is similar to VEX since they're both C-style languages, but it's much simpler and barely has any libraries.

OpenCL is intended for low-level data processing. It doesn't have any high-level functions like `intersect()` or `xyzdist()`, only basic operations like reading, writing and math.

While VEX only runs on the CPU, OpenCL can run on the GPU, CPU and any other devices that support it. It's a general purpose computing language so it's not specific to Houdini.

It's much faster than VEX at certain tasks, like feedback loops (Attribute Blur) and anything involving neighbours (Vellum). It's commonly found in solvers and used for image processing in Copernicus.

Some people get tempted to use OpenCL just because it's fast. While OpenCL is fast, it's painful to use and easy to cause memory leaks if you don't know programming well. For this reason you should only use OpenCL when absolutely necessary. Otherwise it's better to use VEX.

Like VEX, OpenCL supports multithreading so the performance of VEX and OpenCL are similar. OpenCL is only faster if you write code that takes advantage of what it does well.

To take advantage of OpenCL fully, you need to know how OpenCL runs.

## How OpenCL runs

OpenCL runs in parallel. Unlike in VEX, operations cannot run in order.

This makes OpenCL a bad choice for any algorithm that requires order. Such algorithms should be run in VEX instead.

A regular for loop runs in series:

```c
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
```

OpenCL runs in parallel, using chunks instead. If each chunk was 4 items long, it might run in this order:

```c
// |    Chunk 0    |   Chunk 1   |     Chunk 2     |   Chunk 3  |
     8, 9, 10, 11,   0, 1, 2, 3,   12, 13, 14, 15,   4, 5, 6, 7
```

- Chunks are called **local workgroups**. `8, 9, 10, 11` is a **local workgroup** of size 4.
- Each **local workgroup** is part of a **global workgroup**. All of these numbers could be in global workgroup `0`.
- Each number is called a **workitem**. `0` is a workitem.

Like you'd expect, you can access the [offset and sizes](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/get_work_dim.html) for these things.

```c
// Offsets
int global_id = get_global_id(0); // @elemnum when using @ bindings
int local_id = get_local_id(0);
int group_id = get_group_id(0);

// Sizes
int global_size = get_global_size(0); // @attr.len when using @ bindings
int local_size = get_local_size(0);
int num_groups = get_num_groups(0);
```

[Check the OpenCL documentation](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/get_work_dim.html) for more functions you can use.

## @ bindings

@ bindings are an optional feature added by SideFX to save you from writing tedious boilerplate OpenCL code.

I don't recommend using @ bindings until you learn how to write regular OpenCL, because they add another layer of confusion.

@ bindings automatically do these things for you:

- Automatically add bindings to attributes/data (not shown in the "Bindings" tab)
- Automatically add kernel arguments to pass in the attribute/data
- Automatically add `#define` directives to let you access the attribute/data with `@` syntax

@ bindings generate the exact same OpenCL code under the hood, but let you use a VEX-like syntax instead.

You can view the regular OpenCL code by going to the "Generated Code" tab and clicking "Generate Kernel". This is the OpenCL it actually runs.

In in the generated kernel, you'll see a lot of `#define` lines. `#define` is a C preprocessor directive that replaces text with other text. For example:

```c
// Replace hello with goodbye
#define hello goodbye

// Prints "goodbye"
printf("hello");
```

This is exactly what @ bindings are doing. They replace `@P` with the equivalent OpenCL read/write instruction for that data type.

## Worksets in OpenCL

Sometimes you need to run an operation over small sections of a larger bunch of data.

For example, Vellum (XPBD) runs over sections of prims, while [Vertex Block Descent (VBD)](https://github.com/MysteryPancake/Houdini-VBD) and Otis run over sections of points.

<img src="./images/vellum_vs_vbd.png" width="800">

Vellum, VBD and Otis use the Graph Color node to generate these sections. It computes the offset and size of each data section.

To run an operation over data sections, you can use the workset option on any OpenCL node.

<img src="./images/multiple_global_workgroups.png" width="500">

This option runs the same kernel multiple times, with different data lengths. It passes the global index offset as another kernel argument.

I think of this like multiple global workgroups. This diagram isn't really correct though, because it's really the same kernel each time.

## Fix "1 warning generated"

Sometimes OpenCL spams the message "1 warning generated", but doesn't spam the actual warning.

This can be fixed by setting the environment variable `HOUDINI_OCL_REPORT_BUILD_LOGS` to `1` before starting Houdini.

## Copernicus: Radial Blur

Simple radial blur shader I made for Balthazar on the CGWiki Discord. This uses @ binding syntax.

<img src="./images/cops/radial_blur.png?raw=true" width="600">

```c
#bind layer src? val=0
#bind layer !&dst

#bind parm quality int val=10
#bind parm center float2 val=0
#bind parm scale float val=0.2
#bind parm rotation float val=0

@KERNEL
{
    float2 offset = @P - @center;
    float4 result = 0.;
    float scale = 1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= @quality; ++i) {
        result += @src.imageSample(offset * scale + @center) / (@quality + 1);
        offset = rotate2D(offset, @rotation / @quality);
        scale -= @scale / @quality;
    }
    
    @dst.set(result);
}
```
