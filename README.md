# Houdini OpenCL

OpenCL in Houdini doesn't have much documentation, so hopefully this helps someone!

## What is OpenCL?

OpenCL is a general purpose computing language similar to C. It's not specific to Houdini, so OpenCL code can be translated from other places.

It's the lowest level language you can access in Houdini without using the HDK, and can be the fastest if used correctly.

Houdini has many other built-in programming languages including Python, VEX/VOPS and OpenCL.

| Language | Runs on | Pain | Speed | Libraries/helper functions | Supports multithreading
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python | CPU + GPU | Easy | Slow | Many | Yes |
| VEX/VOPS | CPU only | Medium | Fast | Some | Yes |
| OpenCL | CPU + GPU + Anything supporting OpenCL | Hard | Fast | Very few | Yes |

It's easy to be tempted to use OpenCL for everything, but it's not magically faster at everything. Both VEX and OpenCL support multithreading, so their performance is similar most of the time.

OpenCL is only faster if you write code that takes advantage of it. This requires knowing [how OpenCL runs](#how-opencl-runs).

As you'll see on this page, OpenCL is painful to use. For this reason, I recommend always using VEX instead of OpenCL unless absolutely necessary.

## OpenCL strengths

OpenCL is simple and can be the fastest language when used correctly. It's similar to VEX since they're both C-style languages.

While VEX only runs on the CPU, OpenCL can run on the GPU, CPU and any other devices that support it. 

OpenCL is much faster than VEX at certain tasks, like feedback loops (Attribute Blur) and anything involving neighbours (Vellum). It's commonly found in solvers and used for image processing in Copernicus.

## OpenCL weaknesses

OpenCL is painful to use and it's easy to cause memory leaks and crash Houdini if you don't know programming. For this reason, you should only use OpenCL when absolutely necessary.

It's is intended for low-level data processing, so it's missing high-level functions like `intersect()` and `xyzdist()` [(though I'm working on this)](https://github.com/MysteryPancake/Houdini-Fun/blob/main/Primuv_Xyzdist.md). It only supports basic operations like reads, writes and math.

It often requires writing tons of tedious boilerplate code, though this is improved by [@-bindings](#-bindings-at-bindings). It barely supports matrices, requiring `matrix.h` for basic matrix operations.

It doesn't support dynamic sized arrays, assuming most data has a fixed size. However, arrays passed to OpenCL (like attributes) may have different sizes each time the kernel is run.

## How OpenCL runs

OpenCL is only faster than VEX when you write code that takes advantage of what it does well.

OpenCL runs in parallel. Operations can't be run in order like in VEX. This makes OpenCL a bad choice for any algorithm that requires order. These algorithms should be run in VEX instead.

A regular for loop runs in series:

```c
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
```

OpenCL runs in parallel, using chunks instead. If each chunk was 4 items long, it might run in this order:

```c
// |    Chunk 0    |   Chunk 1   |     Chunk 2     |   Chunk 3  |
     8, 9, 10, 11,   0, 1, 2, 3,   12, 13, 14, 15,   4, 5, 6, 7
```

- Chunks are called **local workgroups**. `8, 9, 10, 11` is a **local workgroup** of size 4.
- Each **local workgroup** is part of a **global workgroup**. All of these numbers could be in global workgroup `0`.
- Each number is called a **workitem**. `0` is a workitem.

Like you'd expect, you can access the [offset and sizes](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/get_work_dim.html) for these things.

```c
// Offsets
int global_id = get_global_id(0); // @elemnum when using @-bindings
int local_id = get_local_id(0);
int group_id = get_group_id(0);

// Sizes
int global_size = get_global_size(0); // @attr.len when using @-bindings
int local_size = get_local_size(0);
int num_groups = get_num_groups(0);
```

[Check the OpenCL documentation](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/get_work_dim.html) for more functions you can use.

## OpenCL parallel processing headaches

OpenCL runs in parallel, so what happens if multiple workitems try to change the same data at the same time?

This causes a race condition. One workitem will take priority and god knows which it'll be.

There are various solutions to this:

1. Design your code to avoid this problem to begin with [(for example using worksets)](#1-worksets-in-opencl)
2. [Use atomic operations](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/extensions/ext/cl_ext_float_atomics.html)
3. [Use memory fences](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/atomic_work_item_fence.html)

### 1. Worksets in OpenCL

When reads and writes overlap, you can avoid race conditions by breaking the operation into sections of data that don't affect eachother.

This happens with solvers such as Vellum (XPBD), [Vertex Block Descent (VBD)](https://github.com/MysteryPancake/Houdini-VBD) and Otis.

Vellum runs over sections of prims, while VBD and Otis run over sections of points.

<img src="./images/vellum_vs_vbd.png" width="800">

Vellum, VBD and Otis use the Graph Color node to generate these sections. It computes the offset and size of each data section.

<img src="./images/graph_color.png" width="500">

To run an operation over data sections, you can use the workset option on any OpenCL node.

<img src="./images/multiple_global_workgroups.png" width="500">

This option runs the same kernel multiple times with different data sizes. It waits for the previous kernel to synchronize before going onto the next one. It passes the global index offset as another kernel argument.

I think of it like multiple global workgroups. This diagram isn't correct though, since it's really the same kernel each time.

## @-bindings (at-bindings)

@-bindings are an optional feature added by SideFX to save you from writing tedious boilerplate OpenCL code.

I don't recommend using @-bindings until you learn how to write regular OpenCL, because they add another layer of confusion.

@-bindings automatically do these things for you:

- Automatically add bindings to attributes/data (not shown in the "Bindings" tab)
- Automatically add kernel arguments to pass in the attribute/data
- Automatically add `#define` directives to let you access the attribute/data with `@` syntax

@-bindings generate the exact same OpenCL code under the hood, but let you use a VEX-like syntax instead.

You can view the regular OpenCL code by going to the "Generated Code" tab and clicking "Generate Kernel". This is the OpenCL it actually runs.

In in the generated kernel, you'll see a lot of `#define` lines. `#define` is a C preprocessor directive that replaces text with other text.

```c
// Replace hello with goodbye
#define hello goodbye

// Prints "goodbye"
printf("hello");
```

This is exactly what @-bindings use. They replace `@P` with the equivalent OpenCL read/write instruction for that data type.

## Fix "1 warning generated"

Sometimes OpenCL spams the message "1 warning generated", but doesn't spam the actual warning.

This can be fixed by setting the environment variable `HOUDINI_OCL_REPORT_BUILD_LOGS` to `1` before starting Houdini.

Thanks to [Lewis Saunders](https://x.com/lwwwwwws) for this tip!

## Where to find OpenCL resources

Houdini doesn't have many OpenCL resources. I strongly recommend checking the Houdini files for examples.

The `houdini/ocl` folder in your Houdini directory contains tons of OpenCL files.

```c
// Type this in any text field to evaluate the path
// On Windows: C:/Program Files/Side Effects Software/Houdini <VERSION>/houdini/ocl
$HH/ocl
```

This is also where you find helper libraries, such as the matrix library `matrix.h`.

`#include` means to insert the code from a file into your file. You can do this for any OpenCL file in `houdini/ocl`.

```c
// Type this in any text field to evaluate the path
// On Windows: C:/Program Files/Side Effects Software/Houdini <VERSION>/houdini/ocl/include/matrix.h
$HH/ocl/include/matrix.h

// To include a library located in houdini/ocl/include:
#include <matrix.h>

// To include files in other directories:
#include "../sim/vbd_energy.cl"
```

Another place to look is Copernicus. Some Copernicus nodes contain OpenCL nodes with embedded code inside them.

Though it's uncommon, some solvers like the Ripple Solver contain OpenCL nodes with embedded code inside them.

I'm also working on [a solver written in OpenCL](https://github.com/MysteryPancake/Houdini-VBD). The code is in the `ocl` folder on that page.

## Copernicus: Radial Blur

Simple radial blur shader I made for Balthazar on the CGWiki Discord. This uses @ binding syntax.

<img src="./images/cops/radial_blur.png?raw=true" width="600">

```c
#bind layer src? val=0
#bind layer !&dst

#bind parm quality int val=10
#bind parm center float2 val=0
#bind parm scale float val=0.2
#bind parm rotation float val=0

@KERNEL
{
    float2 offset = @P - @center;
    float4 result = 0.;
    float scale = 1;
    
    for (int i = 0; i <= @quality; ++i) {
        result += @src.imageSample(offset * scale + @center) / (@quality + 1);
        offset = rotate2D(offset, @rotation / @quality);
        scale -= @scale / @quality;
    }
    
    @dst.set(result);
}
```
