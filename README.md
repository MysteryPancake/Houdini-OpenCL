# Houdini OpenCL

OpenCL in Houdini doesn't have much documentation, so hopefully this helps someone!

## What is OpenCL?

Houdini has many built-in programming languages including Python, VEX/VOPS and OpenCL.

| Language | Runs on | Pain | Speed | Libraries/helper functions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | -- |
| Python | CPU + GPU | Easy | Slow |Many |
| VEX/VOPS | CPU only | Medium | Fast | Some |
| OpenCL | CPU + GPU + Anything supporting OpenCL | Hard | Fast | Very few |

OpenCL is the lowest level language you can access in Houdini, and can be the fastest if used correctly.

It's is similar to VEX since they're both C-style languages, but it's much simpler and barely has any libraries.

While VEX only runs on the CPU, OpenCL can run on the GPU, CPU and any other devices that support it. It's a general purpose computing language so it's not specific to Houdini.

It's much faster than VEX at certain tasks, like feedback loops (Attribute Blur) and anything involving neighbours (Vellum). It's commonly found in solvers and used for image processing in COPS.

Some people get tempted to use OpenCL just because it's fast. While OpenCL is fast, it's painful to use and easy to cause memory leaks if you don't know programming well. For this reason you should only use OpenCL when absolutely necessary. Otherwise it's better to use VEX.

Like VEX, OpenCL supports multithreading so the performance of VEX and OpenCL are similar. OpenCL is only faster if you write code that takes advantage of what it does well.

To write good OpenCL code, it helps to know how OpenCL runs operations.

## How OpenCL runs operations

OpenCL runs in parallel, so operations don't normally run in order.

This makes OpenCL a bad choice for any algorithm that must run in order. Such algorithms should be run in VEX instead.

A regular for loop would run in series:

```c
0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
```

OpenCL runs in parallel, so it runs in chunks instead. If each chunk was 4 numbers long, it might run in this order:

```c
// Chunk 0    | Chunk 1   | Chunk 2       | Chunk 3
8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 12, 13, 14, 15, 4, 5, 6, 7
```

- Each number is called a **workitem**. `0` is a workitem.
- Chunks are called **local workgroups**. `8, 9, 10, 11` is a **local workgroup** of size 4.
- Each **local workgroup** is part of a **global workgroup**. All of the above could be in a single global workgroup `0`.

As you'd expect, you can access the offset and size for these things.

```c
// Offsets
int global_id = get_global_id(0); // @elemnum when using @ bindings
int local_id = get_local_id(0);
int group_id = get_group_id(0);

// Sizes
int global_size = get_global_size(0); // @attr.len when using @ bindings
int local_size = get_local_size(0);
int num_groups = get_num_groups(0);
```

[Check the OpenCL documentation](https://registry.khronos.org/OpenCL/sdk/3.0/docs/man/html/get_work_dim.html) for more functions you can use.

Often there's only one global workgroup, but there can be many.

For example if you use worksets, it runs the same kernel multiple times. Conceptually this is like having multiple global workgroups.
